# opx-nas-ndi 
This repository contains the NDI utilities for the OPX project. This software sits between the NAS and the SAI interfaces providing a thin translation layer used to isolate SAI updates from the rest of the software.

## Description
This repository contains APIs to access SAI services. It provides functions that take input data structure from NAS modules and convert it to attributes list accepted by SAI interfaces
